[![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indievox-inc/iNDIEVOX-Web-Profile/master/image/sass-logo.png )](http://sass-lang.com/)

Set up for an intro sass project with Sublime Text

# Installations Using Sublime Text
1. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
2. Install sass package
3. Install scss package
4. Install SASS Build
5. Install [Koala App](http://koala-app.com/) onto your computer

# Preparing Project
1. Create a blank project and open Sublime Text
2. Create index.html and add the default tags
3. Create a CSS and SCSS folder
4. In SCSS create a file named "style.scss:
5. In CSS create a file named "style.css"
6. Open Koala and import the project using the plus symbol in the top right
7. Right click on sass/style.scss and choose "Set Output Path" and then go into css folder and create file named "style.css". It will then ask you if you want to override the exsisting file and click yes.
8. Go into your index.html file and link a stylesheet to "css/style.css"

Your project is now connected to SASS so as you write SASS in the style.scss file, Koala will compile it into css and automatically write it in your style.css
